			<img id="myphoto" src="./assets/images/profileimage.jpg" height=180 width=180 alt="Photo of me" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"><p>Originally from Pensacola, FL I relocated in 2015 to start a new chapter of my life and work for Lockheed Martin here in Orlando. I started working in the Aerospace industry at 23, beginning as an assembler, where I worked on V2500 Common Nozzle Assemblies. A little less than a year later I would be promoted to Quality Assurance, where I would spend the bulk of my 6-year career. I decided to venture out of the Aerospace industry in hopes to expand my resume and gain more work experience in Sales. I worked for Verizon Wireless for 11 months, gaining invaluable customer service experience but relocated with family in December 2015.</p>

			<p class = "p2">I am currently working for a specialty hardware company in Winter Park, FL where I handle Vendor Management/Quality Assurance/Customer Service. My true love is and will always be technology. I built my first gaming computer at the age of 8; started writing code when I was 14 and love to learn. I am currently studying Full Stack Web Development in hopes that I will be able to transition into a position I know I will love and be fully engaged in for the rest of my life.</p>
